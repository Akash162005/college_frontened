    <h1>ABOUT THE COLLEGE</h1>
    <P>Thiagarajar College of Engineering (TCE) is as a Government Aided Autonomous Institution, established in 1957 by the philanthropist Late Karumuttu Thiagarajan Chettiar. TCE is affiliated to Anna University, Chennai, and approved by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). TCE offers a wide array of Undergraduate, Postgraduate and Ph.D. Programs across various disciplines of Engineering, Architecture and Science. The campus is set within a serene and eco-friendly environment surrounded by dense vegetation and best infrastructure facilities.

        Each academic Department at TCE is dedicated to a specific theme, fostering synergy between faculty and students in academic and research endeavours. These themes encompass diverse areas such as Eco-friendly Structures, Power and Energy, Automation, Automotive, Wireless Technologies, Distributed Computing, Database Management, Modelling and Simulation, Material Science, Green Chemistry, and Heritage.
        
        TCE has consistently embraced reforms and upgrades in its Teaching-Learning processes. Noteworthy initiatives include the implementation of a Competency-Based Curriculum and Outcome-Based Education. Since 2018, TCE has adopted the Conceive Design Implement Operate (CDIO) framework, shaping curriculum design, pedagogical methods, and assessment techniques, with adequate hands-on training to students. The institution has also launched Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in 2021 and introduced the Thiagarajar Research Fellowship (TRF) scheme for Ph.D. research scholars, furthering its commitment to academic excellence and research innovation.
        
        The college maintains active industry collaborations with leading global organizations. These collaborations have resulted in the establishment of state-of-the-art laboratories, industry-oriented curriculum design, collaborative projects, professional training programs, student internships, and placements. For instance, Subject Matter Experts from TVS Motors have collaborated with TCE faculty to co-create the curriculum for Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering programs, in addition to the establishment of T S Srinivasan Centre for Automotive Research.
        
        TCE's active participation in the Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP) under the National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has led to innovative teaching and learning processes, faculty development programs, industry-supported research activities, and good governance initiatives.
        
        TCE is involved in national and international ranking frameworks, showcasing its commitment to excellence and quality in education. The institution's programs have been accredited by NBA since 1998, indicating compliance with quality standards in technical education. The programmes offered at institution has garnered numerous accolades, including accreditation by NAAC with a CGPA of 3.47 (out of 4.0) with A+ Grade in Cycle I.  Engineering departments have been recognized with the "Best Industry Linked Technical Institutions award‚Äù by AICTE and the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). Faculty members have earned International Certification in Engineering Education by IUCEE, Cambridge International certification and Wipro Mission 10x. Dr. R. Vasudevan, Professor in the Chemistry Department, received the "Padma Shri" for his pioneering work on plastic roads. TCE students have actively participated and succeeded in events like the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), showcasing their talent and problem-solving abilities.
